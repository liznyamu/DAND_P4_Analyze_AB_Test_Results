CONGRATULATIONS !!!!

### Code Quality
#### All code cells can be run without error.
Hello again! I was your previous reviewer, Miadad. It is great to be able to see your project improve. You must forgive me if there isn’t really much to add in terms of feedback from the previous review. Let’s concentrate on the areas you needed to improve.

#### Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.

### Statistical Analyses

#### All results from different analyses are correctly interpreted.

#### For all numeric values, you should provide the correct results of the analysis.

AWESOME
Getting the stats calculations for both the simulation and z-test correct is difficult at this stage. Great work.

#### Conclusions should include not only statistical reasoning, but also practical reasoning for the situation.
